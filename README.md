# Border-Crossing
### Analysis of a dataset found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/us-border-crossing-data)
The goal is to just go through the data, modify it, highlight the most important information and plot it.

I have decided to try and forecast the data using Keras' LSTM as an extra task.
